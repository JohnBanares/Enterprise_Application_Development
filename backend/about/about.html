    <p>This page provides information about the application and its features.</p>
    <p>It includes explanations on various aspects of the application, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General description of how the application works</li>
        <div class="desc">
            <p>This application follows the MERN stack so the this project is 
                all done in one language JavaScript and the technologies
                consist of MongoDB, Express, Node and React. And follows a 3 tier
                architectre system. 
            </p>
            <p>Presentation Tier: React handles the UI and updates according to user inputs.</p>
            <p>Application Tier: Express and Node handle the communication and acts as a bridge
                to handle user request and server responses.
            </p>
            <p>Data Tier: Mongodb handles the storage of data in this case products</p>

            <h2>The technologies used:</h2>
            <p>Mongodb atlas: A cloud database serive that allows for the development of custom models and provides scalability security and monitoring.</p>
            <p>React: A JavaScript library used for building UI with reusable commponents, allowing for interactivity and seamless user experience</p>
            <p>Node javascript runtime enviroment that allows for the development of web applications and handles the development of backend APIs </p>
            <p>Express: A node web application framework that allows to structure api end points in the backend folder. Simplifies the development of APIs, handling request and responses on the server-side. </p>
            <p>Axios: Used to make creating AJAX requests easier</p>
            <p>React router dom: handles the rendering of components and routes for web navigation</p>

        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Some weaknesses:</h2>
            <p>- Being able to edit multiple containers</p>
            <p>- No image upload</p>
            <p>- Lack of pagination</p>   
            <p>- Lack of input insert validation</p>
            <p>- Unsure if database can be accessed outside my home enviroment</p>

            <p>
                Mongodb-memory-server is a lightweight and in-memory MongoDB server used
                for development and testing environments. 
                This would be more apporopriate as this project is not a production build project.
                However in the future this project is setup for scalability and real world deployment
